Additional notes:
- package created from MSI done with Advanced Installer 17.3
- the installer source for MSI is opensource and available at https://github.com/MartinMiles/Sifon/blob/master/Sifon/Resources/Installer.aip
- as Sifon is a toolbelt for Sitecore instance administrators with a PowerShell host, it DOES require admin rights on machine
- the software intself does not make much sense without Sitecore installed: the one and only useful feature will remain installing Sitecore in Docker in that case
- on the first run Sifon installs PowerShell module (also called Sifon) into c:\Program Files\WindowsPowerShell\Modules\Sifon folder (required for WinRM management)
- having Sitecore installed isn't necessry to enter the main view, despite user will be asked providing these details on the first run in order to create at least 1 profile
- will launch with a profile created with dummy data, but most functions will obviously be disabled
- Chocolatey Uninstaller: included, as it needs to remove PowerShell module being installed at: c:\Program Files\WindowsPowerShell\Modules\Sifon
