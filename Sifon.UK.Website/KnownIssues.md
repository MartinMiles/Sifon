# Known issues

- Restore databases over network share is not yet supported, even if you map a drive. However, restoring just websites works well
- switching between remote and local should update env. specific parameters ie. sites, solr instances, etc: after Initialize procedure completes (the remote folder is defined)
- reveal button does not work well on remote tab
- save and close button is stil disabled even after all scripts complete working
